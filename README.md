# Crop Prediction with Machine Learning

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict the optimal crop for a given field based on soil measurements. It is designed as a portfolio project for students interested in data science and agriculture.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset:** `soil_measures.csv` containing soil metrics (N, P, K, pH) and crop labels.
- **Goal:** Build and evaluate multi-class classification models to recommend the best crop for a field.
- **Techniques:**
  - Data cleaning and exploration
  - Feature engineering and selection
  - Model training with Logistic Regression and hyperparameter tuning
  - Performance evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report heatmap
  - Visualization of feature importance and model results

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Open and run `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Follow the notebook sections for data preparation, modeling, and evaluation.

## Results & Progress
- Achieved 71% prediction accuracy using a multiclass classification model with 20 different crop classes.
- Demonstrated strong performance in a challenging, high-cardinality setting.

## Portfolio Skills Demonstrated
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation and visualization
- Professional notebook structure with markdowns and comments
- Interpretation of results and suggestions for improvement

## Next Steps
- Try other classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Experiment with feature engineering
- Analyze misclassifications and improve model robustness
- Add more visualizations and insights
